            If the world's best cold email is sent but it never reaches the recipient's primary inbox, the email is worthless. Infrastructure is a prerequisite for good outbound - you might succeed with mediocre emails and great infrastructure, but you'll never succeed with great emails if your infrastructure doesn't work.

            {[
              {
                question: "Should I start with email or phone for cold outreach?",
                answer: "Both channels have their strengths, and the most effective approach is often using them in combination. Email works well for initial contact at scale, while phone calls excel at creating real-time conversations. Consider your specific situation: For reaching executives, phones might work better (57% of C-level execs prefer calls). For technical audiences who prefer written information, email might be better to start. The ideal approach is a coordinated multi-channel strategy where emails and calls reinforce each other - for example, sending an email followed by a call reference the email, or calling first and then sending a follow-up email with promised information."
              },
              {
                question: "How many emails should I send per day?",
                answer: "It depends on your infrastructure setup. With the approach described in this handbook, we recommend sending about 20 emails per day per inbox. With 3 inboxes per domain, that's 60 emails per domain per day. Scale your operation by adding more domains rather than increasing the send rate per inbox. This approach mimics natural human sending patterns and reduces the risk of being flagged as spam."
              },
              {
                question: "How many calls should I make per day?",
                answer: "For B2B SaaS outreach, a typical SDR should aim for 40-60 calls per day, resulting in roughly 8-12 meaningful conversations. This volume allows for quality conversations while maintaining sufficient activity levels. However, the number can vary based on your target audience, the complexity of your offering, and how much research is needed before each call. Quality always trumps quantity - 30 well-researched, highly targeted calls will yield better results than 100 generic ones. Many successful teams organize calling into \"power hour\" blocks of focused activity rather than spreading calls throughout the day."
